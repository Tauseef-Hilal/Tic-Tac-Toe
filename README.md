## Features

- Two game modes: vs human and vs AI
- Responsive design that works well on desktop and mobile devices
- Minimalist and intuitive interface that's easy to use

## How to Play

To play the game, simply click on any empty square on the game board to place your mark (either X or O). The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a tie.

To switch between game modes, click on the "vs PLAYER" or "vs AI" button in the game menu.
